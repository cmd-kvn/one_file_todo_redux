# one_file_todo_redux
This is an exercise to practice converting a React app into a React-Redux app using a todo list.
1. First, a `state-one-file` branch will make a todo list React app in a single file (`App.js`).
2. Second, a `state-multi-file` branch will organize the contents of `App.js` from the `state-one-file` branch to their own appropriate files.
3. Then, a `redux-one-file` branch will convert `App.js` from the `state-one-file` branch into a single file React-Redux app.
4. Lastly, a `redux-multi-file` branch will mimic the same plan as the `state-multi-file` branch.

The [example todo list from the Redux docs](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/ExampleTodoList.html) was used as a starting point to make the single file React app in the `state-one-file` branch. In essence, this todo list is coming full circle; starting as a React-Redux app, transforming into a React app, then back to React-Redux.
